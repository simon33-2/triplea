/**
 * Utilility for tracking a sequence of executables.
 *
 * <p>
 * It works like this,
 * We pop the top of the stack, store it in current, then execute it.
 * While exececuting the current element, the current element can push
 * more execution items onto the stack.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * After execution has finished, we pop the next item, and execute it, repeating till nothing is left to exectue.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If an exception occurs during execution, we retain a reference to the current item. When we start executing again, we
 * first push current
 * onto the stack. In this way, an item may execute more than once. An IExecutable should be aware of this.
