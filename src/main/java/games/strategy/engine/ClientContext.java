/**
 * IOC container for storing objects needed by the TripleA Swing client
 * A full blow dependency injection framework would deprecate this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class roughly follows the singleton pattern. The singleton instance
 * can be updated, this is allowed to enable a mock instance of this class to
 * be used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Caution: the public API of this class will grow to be fairly large. For every object we wish to return, we'll have an
 * "object()" method that will returns that same object. When things become hard to manage it'll be a good time
 * to move to an annotation or configuration based IOC framework.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Second note, try to put as much class specific construction logic into the constructor of each class managed by this
 * container. This class should focus on just creating and wiring classes together. Contrast that with generating the
 * data
 * needed to create classes. For example, instead of parsing a file and passing that value to the constructor of another
 * class,
 * we would instead create an intermediary class that knows everything about which file to parse and how to parse it,
 * and we would
 * pass that intermediary class to the new class we wish to create. Said in another way, this class should not contain
 * any 'business'
 * logic.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Third Note: Any classes created by ClientContext cannot call ClientContext in their constructor, all dependencies
 * must be passed to them.
 * Since GameRunner creates ClientContext, similar none of the classes created by Client Context can game runner 2
 * </p>
