 * All delegates must have a zero argument constructor, due to reflection constraints.
 * The delegate will be initialized with a call of initialize(..) before used.
 * Delegates start executing with the start method, and stop with the end message.
 * Delegates can be made accessible to players through implementing an IRemote,
 * and will be called through RemoteMessenger.
